# 💰 dBank – A Decentralized Bank  

dBank is a decentralized finance (DeFi) banking application built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. This project leverages **Motoko, HTML, CSS, and Node.js** to create a secure and transparent banking system where users can deposit, withdraw, and manage their assets in a decentralized manner.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔐 **Decentralized Banking** – No central authority; transactions are managed on the blockchain.  
- 💳 **Deposit & Withdraw Funds** – Users can deposit and withdraw funds securely.  
- 📈 **Live Account Balance** – Real-time updates on your balance.  
- 🌐 **Internet Computer Deployment** – Fully deployed on the ICP blockchain for enhanced security and reliability.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Motoko** – Smart contract development for ICP.  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend for user interaction.  
- **Node.js** – Backend processing and API interactions.  
- **DFX SDK** – Deployment and local testing on ICP.
